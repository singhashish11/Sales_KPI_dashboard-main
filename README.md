Overview
This is a dynamic, high-performance web application designed to democratize data analysis. Instead of relying on hardcoded column names or specific datasets, this "universal" dashboard allows users to upload any standard CSV or Excel file and instantly generate insights. 

It acts as a lightweight alternative to heavy BI tools like Tableau or PowerBI, offering an intuitive, centered UI and dynamic chart generation.

* **Interactive Visualizations:** Powered by `plotly`, featuring:
  * Automated KPI generation.
  * Full-width Time Series / Trend Lines.
